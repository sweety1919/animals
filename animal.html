    <h2>DOG</h2>
    <p>
        A dog is considered a man’s best and most faithful friend. Kids love playing with their pet dogs and when given an opportunity they jump to the idea of writing an essay on my pet animal dog. They try to express their thoughts and feelings about their lovely friend in the best possible way.

     Cat is a very adorable and a cute animal. It is a domestic animal and is kept as a pet. It has very sharp claws and keen eyes that help it in seeing during the night. That means that it has a very good nocturnal vision that is much better than humans.
